Pokémon Glazed Version is set years after HeartGold and SoulSilver. A volcanic eruption caused a separation of Kanto and Johto, leading to the creation of the Johto League south of New Bark Town. The climate in Eastern Johto turned cold, leading to changes in various locations and new areas to explore, such as Evergreen Town and Whitewood City.
