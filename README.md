# Nuzlocke Tracker

## About This Project
This is a customized version of the Nuzlocke Tracker, adapted to fit specific gameplay rules and personal preferences. The primary goal is to create a more accurate and tailored experience for Nuzlocke challenges, enhance the original functionality, and learn Svelte development in the process.

## Modifications and Enhancements
### **Scarlet & Violet Encounter Data**  
   - The encounter data for Scarlet and Violet has been heavily revised. 
   - The original data contained inaccuracies and misinformation that led to certain Pok√©mon being absent from the wild during randomization. These issues have been fixed to ensure a better gameplay experience.
